        <p>The iPhone 7 plus was released in September of 2016, the iPhone 7 and 7pplus look exactly like the iPhone 6 and 6plus. <i>The major milestone of the iPhone 7 plus is that it is now waterproof</i>. The camera on the iPhone has been upgraded larger to make it more pleasing, and there is still no headphone plug in. The iphone7 plus was failing in making the screens bigger because the iPhone 6plus screen was bigger than the iPhone 7 plus screen. The home button is solid and when you use it, it jolts when you apply pressure. When you get your iPhone, it comes with the pair of EarPods, a lightning cord(charger) and a 3.5mm (about 0.14 in) dongle to put regular headphones in. The cheapest thing you can buy at apple that is $9 is the dongle. The iPhone 7 plus camera has a 1.8 28mm (about 1.1 in) wide-angle lens and a 2.8 56mm (about 2.2 in) telephoto lens. At the time, the iPhone 7 plus produced the iOS 10 to give the phone better quality and a bigger upgrade in the phone design.
