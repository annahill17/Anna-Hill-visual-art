<p>The iPhone 8 was released September 22,2017, the iPhone 8 has nothing new except <i>the back has glass and aluminum to make the phone wireless charging</i>. The 8 had sold for $699 for 64GB and $849 for 256GB. The 8 is supposed to be the 4th generation of the iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 comes in 3 colors silver, gold and rose gold. The iPhone 8 now has portrait lighting making the objects in the background blurry and will focus on the main object on the screen. The iPhone 8 will come out with iOS 11 which will have a huge change. Bigger fonts and big apps will be changed in designs. The iPhone 8 is opinionated to be an “upgrade” from a phone that might have been broken. The iPhone 8 also has a smaller battery compared to the other iPhone. The speaker stereo has been upgraded so that it is better than before and has become more impressive.</p>
